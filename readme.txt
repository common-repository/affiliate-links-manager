== Description ==

* Create simple URL redirects.
* Track clicks in your Google Analytics account.
* Reduce load on your server -- this plugin handles redirects efficiently.

The plugin's menu is under "Links" in the admin sidebar.

Developed by [WinkPress](http://winkpress.com/).

== Installation ==
Upload and activate. That's it.

But your site must be using [pretty permalinks](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#mod_rewrite:_.22Pretty_Permalinks.22). 

And to get click tracking, your site must be preconfigured with Google Analytics.
